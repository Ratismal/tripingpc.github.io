    <p class="album-description">I made this song while I was travelling in Montreal.  It was on my laptop, and when I put the SSD into my tower back home, the project file got corrupted, at least I had uploaded the audio file online before.</p>

    <p class="album-description">I started work on The Fight For Potatoes right after publishing my first album Plastic SKies.  I slowly composed some random music over the course of many months.  Some of those songs were even supposed to be featured in some games. (Flying over fields and Strange caves and muddy pits).  I don't know whta happened to these games, I know for Flying over fields, that @SnowdramaGames on Twitter didn't finish his shmup in time for Ludum Dare.  I would also like to add that this album reflects my skill increase.  the last 4 songs were made much more closer to the release date of the album.  And it shows!</p>

    <p class="album-description">This is Plastic SKies, my first and most horrible album, personally, I'd say the only worthy track here is Intensity.  Everything else is just random experiments that kidna turned out to sound decent.  Hope you'll at least get some enjoyment out of this...</p>
