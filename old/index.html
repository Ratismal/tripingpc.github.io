        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my new page! up above are the main ways to contact me.  I am a young adult who freeloads in his mom's basement.  My online personality is basically me being an AI girl. I really really like computers.  I don't know why you're here but hey you found this place... good for you I suppose...  Now go back to your hentai.</h2>

        <h1>Trash I'm working on "currently":</h1>
        <h2>Reconsidering my life after completely privating my Discord bot code.  I realized that open-source wasn't my cup of tea.</h2>
        <h2> Working on an utau called Asaya June. You can <a href="http://tripin.gq/asaya">download her</a> if you care.</h2>
        <h2>Planning to make a new bot, probably not for Discord (Maybe Matrix) that will be a 24/7 AI-powered DJ.</h2>
        <h2>Also, I guess I'm considering getting into 3DS homebrew dev.</h2>

        <h1>Shit I like:</h1>
        <h2>I like chiptunes, like good Famitracker 2A03 tracks or original adlib tracks.  to be honest, just look at my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tripingpc/likes">soundcloud likes to get a better idea.</a></h2>
        <h2>Anime, you can go to <a href="https://hummingbird.me/users/TripingPC" target="_top">my Hummingbird</a> to see all the shit I haven't finished watching.  Basically way too much. (That list is also extremely never updated, like this site...)</h2>
        <h2>I also like composing music myself, you can go on <a href="https://tripingpc.bandcamp.com" target="_top">my Bandcamp page</a> to listen to what I compose.  I might also release some more lit tracks here!</h2>
        <h2>I'm also very much into computers, dicking around with them and trying to get as much power out of aging or underpowered hardware.  Like getting Twitch in 480p going on a pentium 3 laptop or an eMac G4 700mhz. Or playing osu! at 60fps on an Intel Atom N450 netbook.</h2>
        <h2>So those are the things I like, Oh and artificial intelligence devlopment, that's really badass.</h2>
        <h2>And recently, I started to get into BJDs.  Only problem is, they're bloody expensive...</h2>
